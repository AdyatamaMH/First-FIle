# Alien Invasion
A game that has been built in the book entitled "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes. We are going to use his book to make the game that has been implemented in the book called Alien Invasion.

# Introduction
In the Alien Invasion project (Chapters 12, 13, and 14 of the python crash course book), you’ll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. At the end of the project, you’ll have learned skills that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in Pygame.

## Things you will need
- A working python program with the version 3.0 or the most updated one
- Pygame
